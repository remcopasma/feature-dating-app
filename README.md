# SportMatch
## The Concept
When someone searches for a date based on equal interest in different sports, match must be shown based on the tag (sport). The preferences that you as a person indicate for different sports is the basis for the people who are shown to you. In my concept it is about how a match is shown underwater by means of the tags.
